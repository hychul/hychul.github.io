# The seven rules of a great Git commit message

> Keep in mind: This has all been said before.

- Separate subject from body with a blank line
- Limit the subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line
- Wrap the body at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

# 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line

From the `git commit` manpage:

Though not required, it’s a good idea to begin the commit message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example, Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.
Firstly, not every commit requires both a subject and a body. Sometimes a single line is fine, especially when the change is so simple that no further context is necessary. For example:

```
Fix typo in introduction to user guide
```

Nothing more need be said; if the reader wonders what the typo was, she can simply take a look at the change itself, i.e. use `git show` or `git diff` or `git log -p`.

If you’re committing something like this at the command line, it’s easy to use the `-m` option to `git commit`:

```
$ git commit -m"Fix typo in introduction to user guide"
```

However, when a commit merits a bit of explanation and context, you need to write a body. For example:

```
Derezz the master control program

MCP turned out to be evil and had become intent on world domination.
This commit throws Tron's disc into MCP (causing its deresolution)
and turns it back into a chess game.
```

Commit messages with bodies are not so easy to write with the `-m` option. You’re better off writing the message in a proper text editor. If you do not already have an editor set up for use with Git at the command line, read this section of Pro Git.

In any case, the separation of subject from body pays off when browsing the log. Here’s the full log entry:

```
$ git log
commit 42e769bdf4894310333942ffc5a15151222a87be
Author: Kevin Flynn <kevin@flynnsarcade.com>
Date: Fri Jan 01 00:00:00 1982 -0200

Derezz the master control program

MCP turned out to be evil and had become intent on world domination.
This commit throws Tron's disc into MCP (causing its deresolution)
and turns it back into a chess game.
```

And now `git log --oneline`, which prints out just the subject line:

```
$ git log --oneline
42e769 Derezz the master control program
```

Or, git shortlog, which groups commits by user, again showing just the subject line for concision:

```
$ git shortlog
Kevin Flynn (1):
Derezz the master control program

Alan Bradley (1):
Introduce security program "Tron"

Ed Dillinger (3):
Rename chess program to "MCP"
Modify chess program
Upgrade chess program

Walter Gibbs (1):
Introduce protoype chess program
```

There are a number of other contexts in Git where the distinction between subject line and body kicks in—but none of them work properly without the blank line in between.

# 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters

50 characters is not a hard limit, just a rule of thumb. Keeping subject lines at this length ensures that they are readable, and forces the author to think for a moment about the most concise way to explain what’s going on.

> Tip: If you’re having a hard time summarizing, you might be committing too many changes at once. Strive for atomic commits (a topic for a separate post).

GitHub’s UI is fully aware of these conventions. It will warn you if you go past the 50 character limit:

gh1
And will truncate any subject line longer than 72 characters with an ellipsis:

gh2
So shoot for 50 characters, but consider 72 the hard limit.

3. Capitalize the subject line
   This is as simple as it sounds. Begin all subject lines with a capital letter.

For example:

Accelerate to 88 miles per hour
Instead of:

accelerate to 88 miles per hour 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
Trailing punctuation is unnecessary in subject lines. Besides, space is precious when you’re trying to keep them to 50 chars or less.

Example:

Open the pod bay doors
Instead of:

Open the pod bay doors. 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
Imperative mood just means “spoken or written as if giving a command or instruction”. A few examples:

Clean your room
Close the door
Take out the trash
Each of the seven rules you’re reading about right now are written in the imperative (“Wrap the body at 72 characters”, etc.).

The imperative can sound a little rude; that’s why we don’t often use it. But it’s perfect for Git commit subject lines. One reason for this is that Git itself uses the imperative whenever it creates a commit on your behalf.

For example, the default message created when using git merge reads:

Merge branch 'myfeature'
And when using git revert:

Revert "Add the thing with the stuff"

This reverts commit cc87791524aedd593cff5a74532befe7ab69ce9d.
Or when clicking the “Merge” button on a GitHub pull request:

Merge pull request #123 from someuser/somebranch
So when you write your commit messages in the imperative, you’re following Git’s own built-in conventions. For example:

Refactor subsystem X for readability
Update getting started documentation
Remove deprecated methods
Release version 1.0.0
Writing this way can be a little awkward at first. We’re more used to speaking in the indicative mood, which is all about reporting facts. That’s why commit messages often end up reading like this:

Fixed bug with Y
Changing behavior of X
And sometimes commit messages get written as a description of their contents:

More fixes for broken stuff
Sweet new API methods
To remove any confusion, here’s a simple rule to get it right every time.

A properly formed Git commit subject line should always be able to complete the following sentence:

If applied, this commit will your subject line here
For example:

If applied, this commit will refactor subsystem X for readability
If applied, this commit will update getting started documentation
If applied, this commit will remove deprecated methods
If applied, this commit will release version 1.0.0
If applied, this commit will merge pull request #123 from user/branch
Notice how this doesn’t work for the other non-imperative forms:

If applied, this commit will fixed bug with Y
If applied, this commit will changing behavior of X
If applied, this commit will more fixes for broken stuff
If applied, this commit will sweet new API methods
Remember: Use of the imperative is important only in the subject line. You can relax this restriction when you’re writing the body. 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
Git never wraps text automatically. When you write the body of a commit message, you must mind its right margin, and wrap text manually.

The recommendation is to do this at 72 characters, so that Git has plenty of room to indent text while still keeping everything under 80 characters overall.

A good text editor can help here. It’s easy to configure Vim, for example, to wrap text at 72 characters when you’re writing a Git commit. Traditionally, however, IDEs have been terrible at providing smart support for text wrapping in commit messages (although in recent versions, IntelliJ IDEA has finally gotten better about this).

7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
   This commit from Bitcoin Core is a great example of explaining what changed and why:

commit eb0b56b19017ab5c16c745e6da39c53126924ed6

Simplify serialize.h's exception handling

Remove the 'state' and 'exceptmask' from serialize.h's stream
implementations, as well as related methods.

As exceptmask always included 'failbit', and setstate was always
called with bits = failbit, all it did was immediately raise an
exception. Get rid of those variables, and replace the setstate
with direct exception throwing (which also removes some dead
code).

As a result, good() is never reached after a failure (there are
only 2 calls, one of which is in tests), and can just be replaced
by !eof().

fail(), clear(n) and exceptions() are just never called. Delete
them.
Take a look at the full diff and just think how much time the author is saving fellow and future committers by taking the time to provide this context here and now. If he didn’t, it would probably be lost forever.

In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made. Code is generally self-explanatory in this regard (and if the code is so complex that it needs to be explained in prose, that’s what source comments are for). Just focus on making clear the reasons why you made the change in the first place—the way things worked before the change (and what was wrong with that), the way they work now, and why you decided to solve it the way you did.

The future maintainer that thanks you may be yourself!

Tips
Learn to love the command line. Leave the IDE behind.
For as many reasons as there are Git subcommands, it’s wise to embrace the command line. Git is insanely powerful; IDEs are too, but each in different ways. I use an IDE every day (IntelliJ IDEA) and have used others extensively (Eclipse), but I have never seen IDE integration for Git that could begin to match the ease and power of the command line (once you know it).

Certain Git-related IDE functions are invaluable, like calling git rm when you delete a file, and doing the right stuff with git when you rename one. Where everything falls apart is when you start trying to commit, merge, rebase, or do sophisticated history analysis through the IDE.

When it comes to wielding the full power of Git, it’s command-line all the way.

Remember that whether you use Bash or Zsh or Powershell, there are tab completion scripts that take much of the pain out of remembering the subcommands and switches.
